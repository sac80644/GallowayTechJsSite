        <h3>Hi - I'm Jason.</h3>
        I love to learn new things and I have found that to retain the new things that I learn, I have to use
        them...a lot.  And usually at the office I don't get the opportunity to work with a technology that I choose.  I have to work where needed 
        and so maybe I'll pick up a new skill, use it for a week, then the task is over and I have to move onto something else.  
        That is how it has been with me and Javascript since we first met in 2006.  So, I have set out to build a new site for myself 
        composed only of Javascript, front to back.  No Microsoft, no .Net, no Angular, no React nor any frameworks, except that which I design myself.  
        I will even be using NodeJs on the backend.  I'll be checking this site into my <a href="https://github.com/sac80644/GallowayTechJsSite" target="_blank">GitHub</a> account, 
        so check it out.
