                    <h1>What Is a Pattern?</h1>
                    <div class="content">
                        <p>So I don't always have the keenest mind when it comes to abstract thought.  Unfortunately, that is often
                            what patterns deal with.  Let me clarify.  I understand abstractions quite well, it is when you talk about
                            these abstractions in conceptual terms that I have difficulty.  I am a very concrete, hands on person and 
                            what really helps me is to see an idea.  So one day, when I was in my backyard, it occurred to me.
                            I had read recently that once is chance, twice is coincidence and three or more is a pattern.  And at the time my 
                            wife was inside busily knitting.  Oh, sorry hon, I meant crocheting.</p>
                            <h3>Crocheting</h3>
                        <p>Anyways, my wife told me how much she like the repetitive patterns used in her crocheting.  Seeing a completed, or 
                            even partially completed piece of work, a light bulb when off in my head.  I mean, I understood patterns, but now 
                            I could really see them.  Each square of a quilt, all following the same pattern, then connected together to make a 
                            whole.  I already knew that I used patterns all the time, I just did not realize that someone had written a book
                            and gave them names.

                        <p> 
                            Early on in my career I did not think about patterns.  For a while 
                            I just followed in the patterns that the more senior developers 
                            had chosen.  After a while, these patterns became my go to, but 
                            I still had not read about patterns, nor did I know that the pattern 
                            that I was using had a name.  Then I began to become more intentional 
                            in my approach.  I started with "the simplest and most common patterns..."

                                            Adapter lets classes work together that couldn't otherwise because of incompatible interfaces.<br />

                                        Composite lets clients treat individual objects and compositions of objects uniformly.

                                        Decorators provide a flexible alternative to subclassing for extending functionality.

                                        <b>Intent</b> - Define an interface for creating an object, but let subclasses decide which class to instantiate.  
                                        Factory Method lets a class defer instantiation to subclasses.

                                        <b>Intent</b> - Define a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, 
                                        all its dependents are notified and updates automatically.

                                        <b>Intent</b> - Define a family of algorithms, encapsulate each one, and make them interchangeable. 
                                        Strategy lets the algorithm vary independently from clients that use it.

                                        <b>Intent</b> - Define the skeleton of an algorithm in an operation, deferring some steps to subclasses. 
                                        Template Method lets subclasses redefine certain steps of an algorithm without changing the algorithm's structure.

                            <p> 
                                Below are just a few of my favorite patters with a brief reason:
                            </p>
                            <p>Facade: So this pattern was probably the first that I can remember 
                                and the lead developer at the time referred to it as a Wrapper.  This led to a 
                                bit of confusion on my part because there are two other patterns (Adapter and Decorator) 
                                that are also referred to as a Wrapper.  But he was not referring to 
                                the same term.  Just that it wrapped around a more complex process.  The term 
                                does make sense.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Factory: There are many different types of factories.  I have used this one a 
                                lot so it is one of my favorites.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Singleton: Simple and straightforward.  
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Observer: I first saw this one working on my first Federal contract. I haven't seen 
                                it implemented since but it stuck with me.
