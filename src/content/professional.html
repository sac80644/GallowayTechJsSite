                            Here is a simple list of very straight forward things anyone can do to set yourself apart from other workers.  
                            Knowing and excelling at your craft is definately the name of the game, but I have found that there are just 
                            basic skills that so many talented developers, and other professions too, lack.

                            Ok, so some of these things are documented, but perhaps hard 
                            to find.  Just quick thoughts here, things I keep forgetting so I'm 
                            writing them down, etc.
